# Data Storage and Backup Strategy

This page outlines how we store, secure, and backup data for the Socioscope project.

## Overview

A robust storage and backup strategy ensures data durability, availability, and recoverability. This document details our approach to managing data across its lifecycle.

## Storage Architecture

### Primary Storage

- **Database Systems** - Structured data stored in relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Object Storage** - Unstructured data (files, images, documents) stored in S3-compatible object stores
- **Document Stores** - Semi-structured data stored in NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Elasticsearch)

### Storage Tiers

1. **Hot Storage** - Frequently accessed data on high-performance storage
2. **Warm Storage** - Infrequently accessed data on standard storage
3. **Cold Storage** - Archive data on cost-optimized storage

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Types

- **Full Backups** - Complete snapshot of all data (weekly)
- **Incremental Backups** - Changes since last backup (daily)
- **Continuous Backups** - Real-time replication for critical data

### Backup Schedule

| Data Type | Backup Frequency | Retention Period |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Critical Production Data | Continuous + Daily | 90 days |
| Research Datasets | Weekly | 1 year |
| Processed Results | Weekly | 1 year |
| Raw Collection Data | Monthly | 3 years |

### Backup Locations

- **Primary Backup** - Same region, different availability zone
- **Secondary Backup** - Different geographic region
- **Offline Backup** - Periodic archives to offline/tape storage

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **At Rest** - All stored data encrypted using AES-256
- **In Transit** - TLS/SSL for all data transfers
- **Key Management** - Centralized key management system with rotation policies

### Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive systems
- Audit logging of all data access

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** - 4 hours for critical systems
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** - 1 hour for critical data

### Recovery Procedures

1. Assess impact and prioritize recovery
2. Restore from most recent valid backup
3. Verify data integrity post-recovery
4. Resume normal operations
5. Conduct post-incident review

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regular backup verification and test restores
- Storage capacity monitoring and alerting
- Performance metrics tracking
- Annual disaster recovery drills

## Compliance

- GDPR compliance for personal data
- Data retention policies per regulatory requirements
- Audit trail maintenance
- Regular compliance audits

## Best Practices

- Automate backup processes
- Document recovery procedures
- Test backups regularly
- Monitor backup success/failure
- Maintain off-site backups
