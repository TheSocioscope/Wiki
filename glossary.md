# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions of key terms used in the TheSocioscope project and Sleipnir tool.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications that allow different systems to communicate with each other.

**Async (Asynchronous)**
: A programming pattern that allows operations to run independently of the main program flow, enabling better performance for I/O-bound operations.

## B

**Backup**
: A copy of data stored separately to enable recovery in case of data loss or corruption.

**Batch Processing**
: Processing data in groups (batches) rather than one item at a time, typically for improved efficiency.

**Batch Size**
: The number of items processed together in a single batch operation.

## C

**Caching**
: Storing computed results or frequently accessed data in fast-access storage to improve performance.

**Cold Storage**
: Cost-optimized storage tier for infrequently accessed data that can tolerate higher retrieval latency.

**Corpus**
: A large collection of text or data used for research, analysis, or training purposes.

**Composable**
: A reusable function that encapsulates reactive state and logic in Vue 3's Composition API.

**Cron**
: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, used to schedule periodic tasks.

## D

**Data Pipeline**
: A series of data processing steps where the output of one step becomes the input for the next.

**Deprecated**
: Marked as obsolete and scheduled for removal in future versions; still available but not recommended for use.

**Dimensionality Reduction**
: Techniques to reduce the number of features/variables in a dataset while preserving important information.

## E

**Embedding**
: A vector representation of data (text, images, etc.) in a continuous space, capturing semantic meaning.

**Ensemble**
: A method combining multiple models or analyses to produce better results than any single approach.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
: A data integration process that extracts data from sources, transforms it, and loads it into a destination system.

## F

**Fan-Out/Fan-In**
: A processing pattern where work is distributed (fan-out) to multiple parallel processes, then results are merged (fan-in).

**Feature**
: A measurable property or characteristic of data used for analysis or model training.

**Feature Extraction**
: The process of identifying and extracting relevant features from raw data.

## G

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
: European Union regulation on data protection and privacy.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
: A type of large language model architecture developed by OpenAI.

## H

**Hot Storage**
: High-performance storage tier for frequently accessed data requiring low latency.

**Hybrid Stack**
: A prompting stack that combines multiple stack types (sequential, parallel, conditional).

## I

**Idempotency**
: A property where an operation produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed.

**Incremental Backup**
: A backup that only includes data changed since the last backup.

**i18n (Internationalization)**
: The process of designing software so it can be adapted to various languages without engineering changes.

## J

**Job**
: A defined unit of work in Sleipnir that executes a set of prompts to accomplish a specific task.

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
: A lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write.

## L

**Layer**
: An individual processing step within a prompting stack.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
: An AI model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

**Lock File**
: A file that records exact versions of dependencies to ensure reproducible builds or executions.

## M

**Map-Reduce**
: A programming model for processing large datasets by mapping operations across data and reducing results.

**Metadata**
: Data that provides information about other data (e.g., creation date, author, version).

**Module**
: A self-contained unit of code in Sleipnir that encapsulates specific functionality and can be reused.

## N

**NER (Named Entity Recognition)**
: The task of identifying and classifying named entities (people, organizations, locations) in text.

**NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
: A field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language.

**NoSQL**
: Database systems that don't use traditional relational (SQL) database structures.

**Nuxt**
: A free and open-source framework with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant web applications with Vue.js.

## O

**Object Storage**
: A data storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than files or blocks.

## P

**Parallel Processing**
: Executing multiple operations simultaneously to improve performance.

**Pinia**
: The official state management library for Vue.js, replacing Vuex.

**Prompt**
: Instructions or text input provided to an LLM to elicit a specific type of response.

**Prompting Sheet**
: A versioned document containing prompt definitions, configurations, and metadata.

**Prompting Stack**
: A structured sequence of prompts that work together to accomplish a complex task.

**Provenance**
: The origin and history of data, including how it was collected, processed, and transformed.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
: A technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
: An access control method that assigns permissions based on roles within an organization.

**Reprocessing**
: Re-executing processing steps on previously processed data, often due to improved methods or corrections.

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**
: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**
: The maximum acceptable time to restore service after a disruption.

## S

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
: A versioning scheme using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH to communicate the nature of changes.

**Sentiment Analysis**
: The use of NLP to identify and extract subjective information from text.

**Sleipnir**
: The tool developed for TheSocioscope project to facilitate modular, version-controlled prompt engineering and job execution.

**SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**
: Rendering web pages on the server rather than in the browser, improving performance and SEO.

**Stack**
: See Prompting Stack.

**Staging Environment**
: A testing environment that mirrors production, used for validation before deployment.

## T

**Temperature**
: A parameter controlling randomness in LLM outputs; higher values increase creativity, lower values increase consistency.
