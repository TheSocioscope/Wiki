# Reprocessing Corpus Features

This page describes the approach to reprocessing and extracting features from the data corpus.

## Overview

Reprocessing corpus features involves extracting, transforming, and enriching data to enable effective analysis with LLMs and other analytical tools. This process is essential for maintaining data quality and relevance.

## Reprocessing Pipeline

### 1. Feature Extraction

Extract meaningful features from raw data:

- **Text Features**
  - Tokenization and lemmatization
  - Named entity recognition (NER)
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Topic modeling
  - Keyword extraction

- **Structural Features**
  - Document structure analysis
  - Metadata extraction
  - Relationship mapping
  - Temporal patterns

- **Statistical Features**
  - Frequency distributions
  - N-gram analysis
  - Readability metrics
  - Language detection

### 2. Feature Transformation

Transform extracted features for analysis:

- **Normalization** - Standardize feature scales and formats
- **Dimensionality Reduction** - Apply PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP
- **Encoding** - Convert categorical features to numerical representations
- **Aggregation** - Combine features at different granularities

### 3. Feature Enrichment

Enhance features with additional context:

- Cross-reference with external knowledge bases
- Add temporal context
- Incorporate domain-specific annotations
- Apply LLM-based augmentation

## Reprocessing Triggers

### Scheduled Reprocessing

- Periodic updates to maintain data freshness
- Batch processing during off-peak hours
- Incremental processing for new data

### Event-Driven Reprocessing

- Model updates requiring feature re-extraction
- Detection of data quality issues
- Addition of new feature extraction capabilities
- Changes in analysis requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps

1. **Feature Completeness** - Ensure all required features are extracted
2. **Feature Consistency** - Verify consistent feature formats
3. **Feature Accuracy** - Validate against ground truth samples
4. **Performance Metrics** - Monitor extraction success rates

### Error Handling

- Log failed feature extractions
- Implement fallback strategies for missing features
- Quarantine problematic records for review
- Alert on systematic extraction failures

## Version Control

### Feature Versioning

- Track feature extraction method versions
- Maintain versioned feature sets
- Document changes in feature definitions
- Enable rollback to previous feature versions

### Provenance Tracking

- Record feature extraction timestamps
- Log extraction parameters and configurations
- Track source data versions
- Maintain audit trail of reprocessing activities

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing

- Distribute processing across multiple workers
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Stream processing for real-time needs

### Caching Strategies

- Cache intermediate results
- Store frequently accessed features
- Implement lazy loading for expensive features

## Tools and Technologies

- **NLP Libraries** - spaCy, NLTK, Transformers
- **Processing Frameworks** - Apache Spark, Dask
- **Feature Stores** - Feast, Tecton
- **LLM APIs** - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models

## Best Practices

- Document feature definitions and extraction logic
- Version control feature extraction code
- Monitor processing performance and costs
- Regularly review and update feature sets
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Use Cases

### Research Analysis

- Prepare data for thematic analysis
- Extract features for clustering and classification
- Generate embeddings for similarity search

### LLM Processing

- Prepare context for prompt engineering
- Extract relevant segments for focused analysis
- Generate summaries and abstractions
