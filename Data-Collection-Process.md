# Data Collection Process

This page documents the data collection methodologies and procedures used in the Socioscope project.

## Overview

The data collection process is the foundation of our LLM-driven research. This document outlines our approach to gathering, validating, and preparing data for analysis.

## Collection Methodology

### Data Sources

Our data collection draws from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage:
- Academic publications and research papers
- Social media platforms
- Public datasets and APIs
- Survey responses
- Web scraping (where legally permissible)

### Collection Pipeline

1. **Source Identification** - Identify relevant data sources aligned with research objectives
2. **Access Configuration** - Set up authentication, API keys, and access permissions
3. **Data Extraction** - Execute automated collection scripts or manual extraction procedures
4. **Initial Validation** - Perform preliminary checks for data integrity and completeness
5. **Staging** - Store raw data in staging environment for processing

## Data Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks

- **Completeness** - Ensure all required fields are present
- **Accuracy** - Verify data accuracy through sampling and comparison
- **Consistency** - Check for formatting and structural consistency
- **Timeliness** - Validate data freshness and relevance

### Error Handling

- Log all collection errors and exceptions
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Alert on persistent collection issues
- Maintain audit trail of all collection activities

## Ethical Considerations

- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Respect robots.txt and terms of service
- Implement rate limiting to avoid service disruption
- Anonymize personal information where required

## Tools and Technologies

- **Collection Scripts** - Python-based scrapers and API clients
- **Scheduling** - Cron jobs and Apache Airflow for automated collection
- **Monitoring** - Logging and alerting systems for collection health

## Best Practices

- Document data provenance and collection timestamps
- Version control collection scripts
- Maintain metadata about collection parameters
- Regular review and update of collection procedures
